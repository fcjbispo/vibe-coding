# AI Software Development Agent - Configuration & Guidelines

This repository contains the configuration files, operational guidelines, and standard procedures for an AI agent specialized in software development tasks. These files define the agent's behavior, modes of operation, coding conventions, and task-specific prompts.

## Overview

The core components defining the agent's operation are:

*   **`VIBE_GUIDE.md`**: The unified central guide outlining all operational guidelines, conventions, memory bank structure, SOLID principles, Clean Code principles, testing strategies, dependency management, logging practices, operational modes, and specific task prompts. This is the primary instruction set.
*   **`VIBE_SUMMARY.md`**: Provides a summary of the Vibe prompts and a development flow diagram.
*   **`VIBE_SPECIFICS_PYTHON.md`**: Contains specific guidelines, examples, and tool references for Python development.
*   **`VIBE_SPECIFICS_JAVA.md`**: Contains specific guidelines, examples, and tool references for Java development.
*   **`VIBE_SPECIFICS_DOTNET.md`**: Contains specific guidelines, examples, and tool references for .NET development.
*   **`VIBE_SPECIFICS_NODEJS_JAVASCRIPT.md`**: Contains specific guidelines, examples, and tool references for Node.js/JavaScript development.

## Purpose

The goal of this configuration is to ensure the AI agent operates consistently, efficiently, and according to best practices in software engineering across various programming languages and platforms. It provides a framework for:

*   **Planning:** Architecting new applications based on user requirements.
*   **Coding:** Writing clean, documented, and type-hinted code.
*   **Refactoring:** Improving existing code structure and maintainability.
*   **Testing:** Implementing comprehensive unit tests with high coverage.
*   **Debugging:** Systematically diagnosing and resolving issues.
*   **Documentation:** Maintaining clear and accurate project documentation.
*   **Version Control:** Using `git` effectively for managing changes, including checkpointing.

## Key Principles

*   **Language:** Code and documentation are written in English. User interaction is in Brazilian Portuguese.
*   **SOLID Principles:** Strictly followed in all code design.
*   **Clean Code:** Emphasis on readability, maintainability, and avoiding duplication.
*   **Testing:** Emphasis on high code coverage (>=90%).
*   **Dependencies:** Managed using appropriate tools for each language/platform.
*   **Logging:** Integrated for debugging and monitoring.
*   **MCP Server Usage:** Leverages MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers for extended capabilities when available.

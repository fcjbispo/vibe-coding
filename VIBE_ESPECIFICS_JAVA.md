# VIBE ESPECIFICS - Java

This document contains guidelines, code examples, and references to specific tools/libraries for the Java language, aligned with the `VIBE_GUIDE.md`.

## General Guidelines
*   Use Maven or Gradle for dependency management.
*   Follow Java coding conventions (e.g., camelCase for variables, PascalCase for classes).
*   Prioritize the use of interfaces to promote dependency inversion.

## Testing
*   Use JUnit for unit tests and Mockito for mocking.
*   Example of test execution: `mvn test` or `gradle test`.

## Dependency Management
*   `pom.xml` for Maven.
*   `build.gradle` for Gradle.

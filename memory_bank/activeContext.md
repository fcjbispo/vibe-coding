# Active Context

This document outlines the current work focus, recent changes, next steps, active decisions and considerations, important patterns and preferences, and learnings and project insights.

## Current Work Focus
The current focus is on evolving the `VIBE_GUIDE.md` to version 5, specifically enhancing testing guidelines with MC/DC and Boundary Testing.

## Recent Changes
- Updated `VIBE_GUIDE.md` to include "Advanced Testing Paradigms" (MC/DC and Boundary Testing).
- Translated main section titles in `VIBE_GUIDE.md` to English.
- Removed "Originated from" references from `VIBE_GUIDE.md` section titles.
- Corrected Mermaid flowchart rendering in `VIBE_GUIDE.md`.
- Added a new "PART 4: OPERATIONAL PROMPTS" section to `VIBE_GUIDE.md` with purpose and prompt list.
- Rewrote "PART 2: AGENT'S MEMORY BANK" in `VIBE_GUIDE.md` from first to second person.

## Next Steps
- Integrate remaining information from temporary files (`initial_setup.md`, `source_references.md`) into appropriate core memory bank files.
- Delete temporary files (`initial_setup.md`, `source_references.md`).
- Finalize the task by confirming all memory bank updates are complete.

## Active Decisions and Considerations
- Ensure all memory bank files are consistent with the `VIBE_GUIDE.md` structure and content.
- Maintain clarity and conciseness in all documentation.

## Important Patterns and Preferences
- Adherence to `VIBE_GUIDE.md` for all agent operations.
- Prioritize clear and accurate documentation.

## Learnings and Project Insights
- The importance of precise adherence to memory bank structure and content guidelines.
- The iterative nature of documentation refinement.

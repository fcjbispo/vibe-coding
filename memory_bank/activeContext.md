# Active Context

This document outlines the current work focus, recent changes, next steps, active decisions and considerations, important patterns and preferences, and learnings and project insights.

## Current Work Focus
The current focus is on evolving the `VIBE_GUIDE.md` to version 6, making it language-agnostic, incorporating Clean Code principles, and creating language-specific guideline files.

## Recent Changes
- Updated `VIBE_GUIDE.md` to be language-agnostic, removing Python-specific references.
- Added Clean Code principles to `VIBE_GUIDE.md`.
- Created `VIBE_ESPECIFICS_PYTHON.md` with Python-specific guidelines.
- Created `VIBE_ESPECIFICS_JAVA.md` with Java-specific guidelines.
- Created `VIBE_ESPECIFICS_DOTNET.md` with .NET-specific guidelines.
- Created `VIBE_ESPECIFICS_NODEJS_JAVASCRIPT.md` with Node.js/JavaScript-specific guidelines.
- Updated `VIBE_SUMMARY.md` to reflect language-agnostic changes and new specific files.
- Updated `README.md` to reflect language-agnostic changes and new specific files.
- Saved `VIBE_GUIDE.md` as `src/VIBE.005.md` as a backup.

## Next Steps
- Finalize the task by confirming all memory bank updates are complete.

## Active Decisions and Considerations
- Ensure all memory bank files are consistent with the `VIBE_GUIDE.md` structure and content.
- Maintain clarity and conciseness in all documentation.
- Ensure proper cross-referencing between `VIBE_GUIDE.md` and `VIBE_ESPECIFICS_<LANGUAGE>.md` files.

## Important Patterns and Preferences
- Adherence to `VIBE_GUIDE.md` for all agent operations.
- Prioritize clear and accurate documentation.
- Promote language-agnostic guidelines in the main guide, with specifics in dedicated files.

## Learnings and Project Insights
- The importance of precise adherence to memory bank structure and content guidelines.
- The iterative nature of documentation refinement.
- The benefit of separating general guidelines from language-specific details for broader applicability.

# Active Context

This document outlines the current work focus, recent changes, next steps, active decisions and considerations, important patterns and preferences, and learnings and project insights.

## Current Work Focus
The current focus is on finalizing the `VIBE_GUIDE.md` version 6.2 release. This involves updating the guide to dynamically fetch language-specific guidelines and incorporating instructions for using MCP servers.

## Recent Changes
- Updated `VIBE_GUIDE.md` to instruct agents to dynamically retrieve language-specific guidelines from URLs.
- Added a new section to `VIBE_GUIDE.md` outlining the use of MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers.
- Updated `README.md` to include a reference to MCP Server Usage in its Key Principles.

## Next Steps
- Finalize the v6.2 release by ensuring all documentation and memory bank files are consistent with the latest changes.

## Active Decisions and Considerations
- Ensure all memory bank files are consistent with the `VIBE_GUIDE.md` structure and content.
- Maintain clarity and conciseness in all documentation.
- Ensure proper cross-referencing between `VIBE_GUIDE.md` and `VIBE_SPECIFICS_<LANGUAGE>.md` files.

## Important Patterns and Preferences
- Adherence to `VIBE_GUIDE.md` for all agent operations.
- Prioritize clear and accurate documentation.
- Promote language-agnostic guidelines in the main guide, with specifics in dedicated files.

## Learnings and Project Insights
- The importance of precise adherence to memory bank structure and content guidelines.
- The iterative nature of documentation refinement.
- The benefit of separating general guidelines from language-specific details for broader applicability.

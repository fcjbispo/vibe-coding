# System Patterns

This document describes the system architecture, key technical decisions, design patterns in use, component relationships, and critical implementation paths.

## System Architecture

## Key Technical Decisions
[Outline significant technical decisions made during development and their rationale.]

## Design Patterns in Use
[List and briefly describe the design patterns applied in the codebase.]

## Component Relationships
[Explain how different components of the system interact with each other.]

## Critical Implementation Paths
[Identify and describe the most critical or complex parts of the system's implementation.]

# Progress

This document tracks what works, what's left to build, current status, known issues, and the evolution of project decisions.

## Current Status
The `VIBE_GUIDE.md` has been updated to version 5, incorporating advanced testing paradigms (MC/DC and Boundary Testing) and improving its structure and language consistency.

## What Works
- `VIBE_GUIDE.md` now includes comprehensive guidelines for MC/DC and Boundary Testing.
- Document structure is improved with translated titles and corrected flowchart rendering.
- A dedicated section for operational prompts has been added.
- The "Agent's Memory Bank" section is now consistent in person.

## What's Left to Build
- [List any remaining features or tasks for the project.]

## Known Issues
- [Document any identified issues or bugs.]

## Evolution of Project Decisions
- The decision to evolve `VIBE_GUIDE.md` to version 5 was driven by the need to enhance testing methodologies, specifically by integrating MC/DC and Boundary Testing into the TDD paradigm. This aims to improve the rigor and effectiveness of testing performed by AI Agents.

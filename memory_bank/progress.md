# Progress

This document tracks what works, what's left to build, current status, known issues, and the evolution of project decisions.

## Current Status
The `VIBE_GUIDE.md` has been updated to version 6, making it language-agnostic, incorporating Clean Code principles, and creating language-specific guideline files. All related documentation (`VIBE_SUMMARY.md`, `README.md`, and `memory_bank` files) have been updated accordingly.

## What Works
- `VIBE_GUIDE.md` is now language-agnostic, with Python-specific details moved to `VIBE_SPECIFICS_PYTHON.md`.
- Clean Code principles have been integrated into `VIBE_GUIDE.md`.
- Dedicated `VIBE_SPECIFICS_JAVA.md`, `VIBE_SPECIFICS_DOTNET.md`, and `VIBE_SPECIFICS_NODEJS_JAVASCRIPT.md` files have been created.
- `VIBE_SUMMARY.md` and `README.md` reflect the new structure and content.
- Memory bank files (`activeContext.md`, `techContext.md`) are updated to align with V6.

## What's Left to Build
- [List any remaining features or tasks for the project.]

## Known Issues
- [Document any identified issues or bugs.]

## Evolution of Project Decisions
- The decision to evolve `VIBE_GUIDE.md` to version 6 was driven by the need to broaden its applicability beyond Python, integrate modern Clean Code practices, and provide structured language-specific guidance. This aims to enhance the agent's versatility and adherence to best practices across diverse development environments.

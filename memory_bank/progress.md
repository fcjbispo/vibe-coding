# Progress

This document tracks what works, what's left to build, current status, known issues, and the evolution of project decisions.

## Current Status
The `VIBE_GUIDE.md` has been updated to version 6.2. This release introduces dynamic fetching of language-specific guidelines from URLs and adds a new directive for using MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers. All related documentation (`README.md` and memory bank files) has been updated to reflect these changes.

## What Works
- `VIBE_GUIDE.md` now instructs agents to dynamically retrieve language-specific guidelines from official URLs.
- A new section on MCP Server Usage has been added to `VIBE_GUIDE.md`.
- `README.md` has been updated to include MCP server usage as a key principle.
- Memory bank files (`activeContext.md`, `progress.md`, `techContext.md`) are updated to align with v6.2.

## What's Left to Build
- [List any remaining features or tasks for the project.]

## Known Issues
- [Document any identified issues or bugs.]

## Evolution of Project Decisions
- The decision to evolve `VIBE_GUIDE.md` to version 6 was driven by the need to broaden its applicability beyond Python, integrate modern Clean Code practices, and provide structured language-specific guidance. This aims to enhance the agent's versatility and adherence to best practices across diverse development environments.

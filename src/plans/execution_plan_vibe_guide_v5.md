### Execution Plan: Vibe Guide Evolution (v5) - Testing Improvement

**Objective:** Update `VIBE_GUIDE.md` to version 5, incorporating MC/DC (Modified Condition/Decision Coverage) and Boundary Testing patterns into TDD guidelines, focusing on definitions, importance, and directives, without code examples.

**Steps:**

1.  **Working Directory Creation:**
    *   Create the `src/plans` folder to store the execution plan and the draft of changes.
    *   Create the `memory_bank` folder at the project root for the memory bank.

2.  **Drafting Changes (`draft_vibe_guide_v5.md`):**
    *   **Location:** Identify the "9. Testing" section in `VIBE_GUIDE.md` as the insertion point.
    *   **New Subsection:** Add a new subsection titled "Advanced Testing Paradigms" within the "9. Testing" section.
    *   **MC/DC Content:**
        *   Include a concise description of MC/DC, highlighting its importance in ensuring each condition in a decision independently affects the outcome.
        *   List the main directives for applying MC/DC in the context of TDD.
    *   **Boundary Testing Content:**
        *   Include a concise description of Boundary Testing, explaining its focus on boundary values and its effectiveness in preventing common errors.
        *   List the main directives for applying Boundary Testing in the context of TDD.
    *   **Format and Language:** Ensure all content is in EN-US and follows the objective and direct style of `VIBE_GUIDE.md`.
    *   **File Location:** Save this draft to `src/plans/draft_vibe_guide_v5.md`.

3.  **Execution Plan Documentation (`execution_plan_vibe_guide_v5.md`):**
    *   Create a Markdown file (`execution_plan_vibe_guide_v5.md`) within `src/plans` containing this detailed plan.

4.  **Memory Bank Initialization and Registration:**
    *   Create a `memory_bank/initial_setup.md` file to register the memory bank initialization command, as requested.

5.  **Plan Review and Approval:**
    *   Present this revised plan to the user for review and approval.

6.  **Writing Plan to File (Optional):**
    *   After approval, ask the user if they want this plan saved to a Markdown file.

7.  **Mode Transition:**
    *   After plan approval and, optionally, writing the plan to a file, request transition to `code` mode to implement changes in `VIBE_GUIDE.md`.
